# Welcome to celmec's documentation

Celmec aims to be a rust library for celestial mechanics simulations.

Currently it contains the functionality to solve the time evolution of a two-body orbit in the reference frame of one of the bodies if either:

1. The masses of the bodies id known and the initial position and velocity of the other body relative to the "reference frame body" are known.
2. The orbital (Keplerian) elements of the other body are known.

This documentation is currently structured as follows:

1. An installation and "Quickstart" guide to qet something quickly done with the library
2. Description of the functions available in the library
3. Physical underpinnings of the library

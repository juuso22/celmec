# Celmec

Celmec aims to be a rust library providing tools do to celestial mechanics simulations.

## TODO

1. Calculate Kepler problem orbit from masses
2. Make open source and publish as crate
3. Configurable number of Fourier series terms and iterative Kepler equation solving for true anomaly
4. First order perturbations
5. Gauss's orbit determination method
